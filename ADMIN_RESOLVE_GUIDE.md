## Tips for Good Admin Feedback

### ✅ DO:
- Be specific about what was done
- Include date/time of fix
- Mention who did the work (if known)
- Describe the current state
- Use clear, simple language

**Good Examples:**
- "Pothole filled with cold asphalt on 12/21/2025 at 10:00 AM. Surface leveled and safe for vehicles."
- "Fallen tree branch removed by city crew on 12/20/2025. Road cleared and reopened to traffic."
- "Flooding issue resolved by clearing drainage system on 12/19/2025. Water flow restored."

### ❌ DON'T:
- Be vague: "Issue fixed"
- Skip important details
- Use technical jargon
- Be negative or dismissive

**Bad Examples:**
- "Done" ❌ (Too vague)
- "Fixed it yesterday" ❌ (Not specific enough)
- "PW dept cleared the culvert per SOP" ❌ (Too technical)

## Evidence Photo Guidelines

### What Makes a Good Evidence Photo:
✅ Clear view of the resolved issue
✅ Shows the fixed area prominently
✅ Good lighting (not too dark)
✅ In focus
✅ Shows context (surrounding area)

### Examples:
- Before: Pothole in road → After: Filled pothole
- Before: Debris blocking lane → After: Clear road
- Before: Broken guardrail → After: Repaired guardrail

### Photo Requirements:
- Format: PNG, JPG, GIF, WebP
- Size: Maximum 5MB
- Resolution: Any reasonable resolution
- Orientation: Any (will display automatically)
