# RoadAlert System - Complete Implementation Summary

## 🎯 System Overview
A comprehensive road hazard reporting system with separate interfaces for users and administrators, featuring real-time database integration, image uploads, and interactive mapping.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Backend Server (Port 3001)
- **Framework**: Express.js + Node.js
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas
- **File Storage**: Local uploads with static serving
- **Features**: 
  - REST API for all operations
  - Image upload with multer
  - Status management (pending → verified/rejected)
  - Real-time data polling

### User Frontend - Client App (Port 5174)
- **Framework**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Purpose**: Public interface for road users
- **Features**:
  - User registration and authentication
  - Report submission with image upload and geolocation
  - Feed showing only verified reports
  - Interactive maps with report locations
  - Real-time updates

### Admin Frontend - Dashboard (Port 5173)
- **Framework**: React + JavaScript + Vite
- **Purpose**: Administrative interface for authorities
- **Features**:
  - Dashboard with real-time statistics
  - View all reports (pending, verified, rejected)
  - Accept/reject pending reports
  - Detailed view modal with maps and images
  - Reports management interface

## 🔄 Complete Workflow

### 1. User Submits Report
- User fills out form with:
  - Report type (pothole, debris, flooding, etc.)
  - Description
  - Severity level
  - Location (address + GPS coordinates)
  - Image upload
- Report saved as "pending" status in database

### 2. Admin Reviews Report
- Admin sees report in dashboard statistics
- Admin can view detailed information including:
  - All report metadata
  - Uploaded images
  - Interactive map with pinned location
  - Reporter information

### 3. Admin Takes Action
- **Accept**: Report status → "verified", appears in public feed
- **Reject**: Report status → "rejected", hidden from public

### 4. Public Feed Updates
- Client app automatically polls for updates
- Only verified reports shown to users
- Real-time synchronization across all interfaces

## 🖼️ Image Handling
- **Upload**: Multer middleware for file processing
- **Storage**: Local filesystem in `/uploads` directory
- **Serving**: Static file serving with CORS headers
- **Display**: Dynamic URLs pointing to backend server
- **Fallback**: Placeholder images for missing/broken files

## 🗺️ Mapping Features
- **Client App**: React Leaflet with interactive controls
- **Admin Dashboard**: Embedded OpenStreetMap in modal
- **Features**: 
  - Pinpoint location markers
  - Zoom controls
  - Address display
  - Coordinate precision

## 📊 Real-time Features
- **Dashboard Stats**: Live counts from database
- **Report Lists**: Auto-refresh every 5-10 seconds
- **Status Updates**: Immediate synchronization
- **Cross-platform**: Updates reflected across all interfaces

## 🔒 Access Control & Separation
- **Client App**: Public access, only verified reports visible
- **Admin Dashboard**: Administrative access, all reports visible
- **API Endpoints**: Proper segregation of public vs admin data
- **Authentication**: Ready for implementation (routes prepared)
