# 🤖 AI Privacy Protection - Quick Guide

## What is it?

When you capture a photo for your road report, our AI automatically detects and blurs any faces in the image to protect everyone's privacy.

## How does it work?

1. **Take a photo** using the camera button in the report form
2. **AI analyzes** the image in real-time (takes 1-2 seconds)
3. **Faces are blurred** automatically - you don't need to do anything!
4. **Submit your report** as normal

## Example

### Before AI Processing
![Original Image with Visible Faces]

### After AI Processing
![Same Image with Blurred Faces]

## What gets blurred?

- ✅ **Faces** - All facial features
- ✅ **Heads** - Including hair and ears
- ✅ **Multiple people** - All faces in the frame

## What stays clear?

- ✅ **Road conditions** - Potholes, debris, flooding
- ✅ **Signs and landmarks** - Street signs, buildings
- ✅ **Vehicles** - Cars, trucks (except faces inside)
- ✅ **Everything else** - Your report evidence remains clear

## When does it work?

✅ **Always active** when capturing photos in:

❌ **Not applied** to:

## What if no faces are detected?

If the AI doesn't find any faces in your image, you'll see:
> "✅ Image captured - no faces detected"

This is normal for:
- Road-only shots
- Distant photos
- Photos with no people

## What if AI fails?

In rare cases, face detection might fail. Don't worry:
- Your image is still captured
- You can still submit your report
- You'll see a message: "⚠️ Privacy protection unavailable"

## FAQs

### Q: Can I disable face blurring?
**A**: No. This feature is always on to protect everyone's privacy.

### Q: What if I want to show a person?
**A**: For safety reports, it's best to focus on the road condition, not people. If you need to report someone's actions, describe it in text.

### Q: Does this work on my phone?
**A**: Yes! Works on all modern smartphones (iPhone, Android) using Chrome, Safari, Firefox, or Edge.

### Q: Does it use my data/internet?
**A**: The AI model downloads once (1MB) and is cached. After that, it works offline.

### Q: Is it accurate?
**A**: Yes! 95%+ accuracy for frontal faces. May miss extreme angles or obstructed faces.

### Q: What if someone's face isn't blurred?
**A**: Contact support and we'll manually blur it. The AI is very good but not perfect.

## Tips for Best Results

### ✅ **Do:**
- Focus on the road condition
- Capture from a safe distance
- Ensure good lighting
- Frame the hazard clearly

### ❌ **Avoid:**
- Taking close-ups of people
- Photos where people are the main subject
- Photos in very dark conditions (faces harder to detect)
